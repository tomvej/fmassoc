Each model has a unique ID -- this is generated using UUID (still, it might be better to check if UUIDs clash).

A model entry is stored in the node `org.tomvej.fmassoc.parts.models' and subnodes (IEclipsePreferences.node())
labels: UUID=label
loaders: UUID=loader id (class name)

Each loader stores its data according to its own implementation, and receives UUID as a parameter.

Loader produces a wizard which is used both in model loading and editing.
