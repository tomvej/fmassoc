FMASSOC ARCHITECTURE
The core will only provide part placeholders for parts (via application model) and communication primitives. Other things will be done via fragments which
will register the appropriate part.

COMMUNICATION
There are three modes of communication:

	A. CONTEXT
	Everything will be placed into context.
	Use perspective context for data generated by parts or application context.

	B. EVENT SERVICE
	For data which need to be accessible immediately outside of commands (e.g. data model for source and destination;
	commands use context polling). Data must also be added to context.

	C. SELECTION SERVICE
	Reserved for selected path. Must be placed into context?
